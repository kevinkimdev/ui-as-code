This repo tracks design work to try to extend Dart syntax to better support
Flutter's style of UI code and similar code in other frameworks.

Usual caveats apply: the work is early, experimental, and subject to change. It
might not pan out at all.

## Docs

*   [Motivation][] - A detailed breakdown of the current usability problems that
    we're trying to improve.

*   [Constraints][] - Softer guiding principles to help get as much value as we
    can from a solution.

*   [Research][] - Background information on other languages and frameworks and
    how they approach this. Prior art, inspiration, and pitfalls to avoid.
    [JSX][] gets its own page.
