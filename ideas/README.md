This directory stockpiles all ideas I've had or come across that might
potentially be useful for improving UI as code.

I don't promise that anything in here is useful, original, well-thought-out, at
all likely to see the light of day, a good idea, or even well-formed. There may
be things that exist here solely to be examples of what *not* to do.

Think of it as a braindump for inspiration.
