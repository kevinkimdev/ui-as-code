These examples show what Flutter code could look like based on:

*   Supporting all of the language changes in the [Parameter Freedom][]
    proposal.

*   Turning any parameter named `child` in the Flutter API into a positional
    parameter.

*   Turning any parameter named `children` in the Flutter API into a rest
    parameter.

*   Using spread arguments where applicable.
