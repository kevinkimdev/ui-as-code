This directory contains proposals that ended up *not* working out. They may be
fatally flawed, incomplete, unpopular, misguided, or otherwise. Reasons to keep
them at all instead of consigning them to the dustbin of history include:

*   To "show my work" and give others some visibility into the ideas I've been
    working on.

*   To open the door a little bit on the messy, difficult side of language
    design.

*   To serve as a reference for why a given path was *not* chosen.

*   Parts of these proposals may be salvageable.

*   Schadenfruede.
