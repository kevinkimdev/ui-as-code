## About the problem

* ["Putting build() methods on a
  diet"](https://flutter.rocks/2018/06/18/putting-build-methods-on-a-diet/) -
  Shows workarounds for big nested Flutter `build()` methods.

## Other languages

### JSX

* See separate [JSX evaluation](https://github.com/munificent/ui-as-code/blob/master/JSX.md)

### Lua

Lua was designed as [a data and configuration language](https://www.lua.org/pil/10.1.html) as much as it was a scripting language.

### C#

*   [Object and collection initializers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers).

## Other stuff to learn more about:

    [E4H](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/e4h/strawman)
*   [XML literals in
    Scala](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/10-xml-expressions-and-patterns.html).
    The syntax directly creates objects of a built-in set of XML classes.
    Odersky now [describes them as a
    mistake](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-language/PV4q6O1qIh8/discussion).

    interpolation](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/dropped/xml.html).
